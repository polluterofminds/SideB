# Side B

Side B is an iOS native app that plays NFT music and so much more. Let's dive in!

## Problem

Music NFTs have not set artists free in the way they expected. The only path to revenue is through sales of the NFTs all while the music remains public to anyone who wants to listen to it for free. Those that buy the NFTs *might* be true fans, or they might be speculators. Outside of making money, artists still don't have a good way to connect and engage with fans who listen to their music. 

For fans of music, discovering artists is still a challengeâ€”especially in web3. Beyond discovery, remembering what you liked is even harder. In the web2 world, Spotify creates Spotify Wrapped every year, but fans don't have access to this data directly. If they did, they could build their own "Wrapped" every day if they wanted. Fans would never forget who they listened to because it would always be available. 

## Solution

Side B solves both problems by leveraging the Flow blockchain's scalability and affordability. Public music NFTs are streamed through a native iOS app. Every time someone finishes a song, an NFT is minted and deposited into that listner's Flow wallet. The NFT represents each unique listen. So, if a fan listens to a single song 100 times, they would have 100 NFTs for that song, all date stamped on chain. This creates an open and queryable mechanism for fans to discover their listening habits. 

Artists can connect their wallets and find all of the fans who have listened to their music. They can explore their most engaged fans. They can create listening party's and verify the engagement on those parties. And because each listen is an NFT, artists can token-gate experiences and merchandise for specific cohorts of listeners. Imagine an artist creating a shirt for fans who participated in a Christmas Day listening party. Artists can find everyone who participated easily using Side B. 

## Status 

Side B is current in the proof of concept phase. We have [deployed the NFT minting contract to the Flow Testnet here.](https://testnet.flowscan.org/contract/A.3f99d68674bc7afa.BSide)
